	<h2>META-SHARE Members</h2>
	<div class="content_box">
	<p>All organisations wishing to become META-SHARE members, by signing the <a href="http://www.meta-net.eu/meta-share/memorandum-of-understanding">META-SHARE Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)</a> undertake the following obligations:</p>
	<ul> 
	  <li>to follow the META-SHARE metadata schema, as defined in the <a href="http://www.meta-net.eu/meta-share/metadata-schema/">META-SHARE Metadata specifications document</a>;</li>
	  <li>to clear all rights before conferring an LR to the network;</li>
	  <li>to store the LRs and metadata in their repositories OR use one of the META-SHARE hosting Repositories;</li>
	  <li>to maintain an inventory (a local inventory) with all the metadata records of their LR OR use one of the META-SHARE hosting Repositories;</li>
	  <li>to keep  identifiers for all their LRs;</li>
	  <li>to adhere to the META-SHARE <a href="#Notice_and_Take_Down_Policy">Notice and Take Down policy</a></li>
	  <li>to export the metadata records of their LRs and allow their harvesting and synchronization by the META-SHARE Managing Nodes</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Members can:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>search the central inventory using multifaceted search facilities;</li>
	  <li>access the actual resources by visiting the local and/or hosting Repositories for browsing and downloading them;</li>
	  <li>get information about the usage of specific resources, their relation (e.g. compatibility, suitability, etc) to other resources as well as recommendations;</li>
	  <li>get statistics on number of downloads, types of consumers, etc.</li>
	</ul>

	<div id="META-SHARE_Repositories" class="anchor"></div>
	<h2>META-SHARE Repositories</h2>
	<div class="content_box">
	<p>META-SHARE Repositories are set up, operated and maintained by META-SHARE Members, acting as META-SHARE Repository Service Providers. META-SHARE Repositories can have a local or hosting (non-local) role.</p> 
	<p>Local repositories are set up and maintained by organisations participating in the META-SHARE network, storing their own resources.</p>
	<p>Hosting repositories are also set up and maintained by organisations participating in the META-SHARE network acting as storage and documentation facilities for resources either developed in organisations not wishing to set up their own repository, or donated or considered orphan resources, i.e. resources without an owner. A hosting repository may also store its own resources.</p>
	<p>Every LR in META-SHARE has to be primarily assigned to one of the network's repositories, with the member maintaining that repository undertaking the curation of the resource.</p>
	<p>META-SHARE Members maintaining repositories are responsible for providing to the Managing Nodes all the information necessary for them to fulfill their mission.</p>
	<p>META-SHARE Members depositing their language resources to a META-SHARE hosting repository will take all reasonable steps so that the META-SHARE Managing Nodes and repositories are able to perform their respective tasks and obligations.</p>

	<div id="META-SHARE_Managing_Nodes" class="anchor"></div>
	<h2>META-SHARE Managing Nodes: Core Service and User Support Service Providers</h2>
	<div class="content_box">
	<p>A number of members with certain technical and organisational characteristics undertake the role of META-SHARE Managing Node acting as <a href="#META-SHARE_Core_Services">Core Service</a> and <a href="#META-SHARE_User_Support_Services">User Support Service</a> Providers with the obligation to provide one or more of the Core Services critical to the whole of the META-SHARE network.</p>
	<p>META-SHARE Managing Nodes harvest and store metadata records from the META-SHARE Nodes of the entire META-SHARE Network. META-SHARE Managing Nodes share metadata, create, host and maintain a central inventory which includes metadata-based descriptions of all language resources available in the distributed network. Each META-SHARE Managing Node effectively hosts a copy of the central inventory.</p> 
	<p>META-SHARE Members meeting the organizational and technical standards necessary to provide Core Services and User Support Services can be invited and introduced as new Managing Nodes, in accordance to the procedures of the META-SHARE network.</p> 
	<p>META-SHARE Managing Nodes do not have any additional privileges with respect to access to LRs.</p>
	<p>The following Members initially assume the role of META-SHARE Managing Node  and act as Core Service and User Support Service Providers: CNR, DFKI, ELDA, FBK, ILSP</p>
	
	<div id="META-SHARE_Core_Services" class="anchor"></div>

	<div id="Metadata_Schema" class="anchor"></div>
	<h2>Metadata Schema</h2>
	<div class="content_box">
	<p>In the context of META-SHARE, the term metadata refers to descriptions of Language Resources, encompassing both data sets (textual, multimodal/multimedia and lexical data, grammars, language models etc.) and tools/technologies/services used for their processing.</p>
	<p>The META-SHARE metadata descriptions will constitute the means by which LR users will identify the resources they seek in the META-SHARE context. Thus, the META-SHARE metadata model forms an integral part of the search and retrieval mechanism, with a subset of its elements serving as the access points to the LRs catalogue. The model is, therefore, as informative and flexible as possible, allowing for multi-faceted search and viewing of the catalogue, as well as dynamic re-structuring thereof, offering LR consumers the chance to easily and quickly spot the resources they are looking for among a large bulk of resources. Although META-SHARE aims at an informed community (HLT specialists), this should by no means be interpreted as a permission to create an overly complex schema; user-friendliness of the search interface is supported by a well motivated, easy-to-understand schema.</p>
	<p>In this effort, we build upon previous initiatives so that the model is easily adopted by the target community. The aim is not to create yet another metadata model but rather to adapt existing resource description models to a unified proposal catering for the specific requirements of the community.</p>
	<p>META-SHARE promotes the use of widely acceptable standards for language resource building ensuring the maximum possible interoperability of language resources, as documented in "The Standards' Landscape Towards an Interoperability Framework".</p>
	<p>As a general framework, the mechanism adopted is the component-based mechanism grouping together semantically coherent elements and relations as well as other components. More specifically, elements are used to encode specific descriptive features of the LRs, while relations are used to link together resources that are both included in the META-SHARE repository (e.g. original and derived, raw and annotated resources, a language resource and the tool that has been used to create it etc.), as well as resources with related entities (e.g. documentation manuals, publications, standards used, licences etc.).</p>
	<p>In order to accommodate flexibility, the elements belong to two basic levels of description:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>an initial level providing the basic elements for the description of a resource (minimal schema), and</li>
	    <li>a second level with a higher degree of granularity (maximal schema), providing more detailed information on each resource .</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The maximal META-SHARE metadata model comprises all elements and relations assisting the description of LRs put together in components. Elements will be linked to existing ISOCcat DCR data categories and, if they have no counterpart, these will be added with appropriate definitions. Specific profiles will be built for distinct LR types (and subtypes) using the various components, providing also exemplary instantiations (e.g. for wordnet-type resources, for parallel corpora, for treebanks etc.) as guiding assistance to LRs metadata providers.</p>

	</p>
	<p>This document presents the metadata schema developed for META-SHARE. It is meant to act as a user manual, providing explanations on the model contents for LRs providers and LRs curators that wish to describe their resources in accordance to it.</p>

	<h2>LR Sharing within the META-SHARE Network</h2>
	<div class="content_box">
	<p>All META-SHARE members have full access to the META-SHARE infrastructure and the META-SHARE Commons licensed LRs for as long as they retain their membership status, as well as all other LRs in accordance to the LRs relevant licensing terms.</p>  
	<p>META-SHARE metadata are licenced under the Creative Commons Attribution Unported (CC-BY) version 3.0 or higher, or the EU Open Metadata Licence. All META-SHARE members and associate members are obliged to allow the harvesting of their meta-data.</p>
	<p>META-SHARE members are encouraged, when they publish or distribute a Resource or any Derivative, to redeposit the Derivative work in the META-SHARE network.</p>
	<p>LRs available under a licence allowing redistribution may be replicated and flow in the META-SHARE network  according to the terms and conditions specified in the respective licence.</p> 
	<p>Members maintaining repositories are responsible for all LRs entering the META-SHARE network through their repositories:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>If the LR comes with a 3rd party licence, this member is responsible for properly documenting the licence in the metadata and ensuring its terms and conditions are clearly available to all members of the network;</li>
	  <li>If the LR comes with a Share-alike licence, this member should take all necessary and reasonable measures, so that any subsequent derivative works and their authors may be identified;</li>
	  <li>If this member has all IPR over the LR, then this member is encouraged to use one of the <a href="#Licensing_LRs_through_META-SHARE">licences recommended by META-SHARE</a>, i.e. a Creative Commons (CC), or a CC-compatible, licence, or a META-SHARE Commons, or a META-SHARE No Redistribution licence, or an Open Source Software licence.</li> 
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div id="Licensing_LRs_through_META-SHARE" class="anchor"></div>
	<h2>Licensing LRs through META-SHARE</h2>
	<div class="content_box">
	<p>Any grant of access to LRs through META-SHARE should include not only the right to read  the relevant content but also to allow transformative uses, dissemination and distribution of such resources and their derivatives, according to the needs and policies of LR owners and users. To limit the complexity of licensing, <a href="http://www.meta-net.eu/meta-share/licenses">a range of recommended license setups are provided</a> by META-SHARE in the form of templates or ready-made licences for the members to choose from.</p>
	<p>The META-SHARE model licensing scheme, with a firm orientation towards the creation of an openness culture and the relevant ecosystem for LRs, is organised on the following axes, further described in the paragraphs to follow:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Creative Commons</b> licences (starting with Creative Commons Zero (CC-0) and all possible combinations along the CC differentiation of rights of use) are the first level of legal machinery applied.</li>
	  <li>A second layer includes <b>META-SHARE Commons</b> Licences, a fully developed CC-based licensing tool that allows META-SHARE members and Extraneous Depositors to make their resources available to other network members only.</li>
	  <li>The third legal layer is a set of licenses that allow use and exploitation of the Resources while permitting the LR Owner to have full control over the Resource distribution. These <b>“No Redistribution”</b> licences will effectively help get “closed” resources safely out to the community. These licenses also come with a Commercial flavour and are accompanied by their for-a-fee counterparts.</li>
	  <li>Software tools and network services are either provided though one of the standard <b>Open Source</b> licenses or under a custom commercial license. Open Source Licenses proposed by META-SHARE include BSD, GPL, LGPL, Apache and AGPL. Other open licences are not excluded, but LR owners are being advised to always keep in mind certain selection criteria that will allow their LRs to be legally easy and straightforward to share.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These ready-to-use licensing schemes are as quick and easy to apply as possible, in particular for new resources. A META-SHARE helpdesk facility ({% encrypt_email 'helpdesk-legal@meta-share.eu' %}) has been set up for assistance in understanding, choosing and using any of these licence and other legal tools.</p>
	<p>The rights of use of the resource, any possible restrictions, as well as rights and restrictions on the original raw data are under the control and responsibility of the resource owners. The repository in which the resource resides acts mainly as a facilitator for the search-and-get procedure while providing guidelines and metadata curation activities.</p>
	<p>Metadata elements regarding rights of use, availability and distribution are among the mandatory elements of the minimal metadata schema and are harvested by the central META-SHARE servers so that users (essentially language resource consumers) can promptly understand what they are allowed to do with a specific resource. Users are asked to always refer to these metadata before using any of the resources on META-SHARE.</p>
	<p>Soon, we will be providing a set of guidelines on the use of the proposed licensing scheme, according to their specific features, as an additional online help.</p>

	<div id="Notice_and_Take_Down_Policy" class="anchor"></div>
	<h2>Notice and Take Down Policy</h2>
	<div class="content_box">
	<p>If a rights holder is concerned that she has found Language Resources (LRs) on one of the META-SHARE repositories, for which she has not given permission, granted a licence or is not covered by a limitation or exception in national law, such rights holder is asked to contact META-SHARE through the META-SHARE Legal Helpdesk ({% encrypt_email 'helpdesk-legal@meta-share.eu' %}), in writing stating the following:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Her contact details.</li>
	  <li>The full bibliographic details of the LR.</li>
	  <li>The exact and full URL where she found the LR.</li>
	  <li>Proof that she is the rights holder and a statement that, under penalty of perjury, she is the rights holder or are an authorised representative.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Upon receipt of notification the ‘Notice and Takedown’ procedure is then invoked as follows:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>META-SHARE will acknowledge receipt of your complaint by email or letter and will make an initial assessment of the validity and plausibility of the complaint.</li>
	  <li>Upon receipt of a valid complaint, the LR will be temporarily removed from the META-SHARE catalogue pending an agreed solution.</li>
	  <li>META-SHARE will contact the member who deposited the material. The META-SHARE member will be notified that the material is subject to a complaint, under what allegations, and will be encouraged to assuage the complaints concerned.</li>
	  <li>The complainant and the META-SHARE member will be encouraged to resolve the issue swiftly and amicably and to the satisfaction of both parties, with the following possible outcomes:
	    <ul>
	      <li>The LR is replaced on the META-SHARE inventory unchanged.</li>
	      <li>The LR is replaced on the META-SHARE inventory with changes.</li>
	      <li>The LR is permanently removed from the META-SHARE inventory.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>If the META-SHARE member and the complainant are unable to agree a solution, the LR will remain unavailable through the META-SHARE inventory until a time when a resolution has been reached.</li>
