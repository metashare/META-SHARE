META-SHARE SOFTWARE
===================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/metashare/META-SHARE.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/metashare/META-SHARE)

META-SHARE Software is the software powering META-SHARE.

META-SHARE is a sustainable network of repositories of language data, tools and
related web services documented with high-quality metadata, aggregated in
central inventories allowing for uniform search and access to resources. Data
and tools can be both open and with restricted access rights, free and
for-a-fee. META-SHARE targets existing but also new and emerging language data,
tools and systems required for building and evaluating new technologies,
products and services. META-SHARE is developed under the umbrella of the
META-NET initiative (http://www.meta-net.eu).

This software is mainly relevant for people or organizations that would like to
run their own META-SHARE node. If you would like to only use the META-SHARE
network, e.g., for searching and accessing language resources, you probably
better move on to http://www.meta-share.eu/.
