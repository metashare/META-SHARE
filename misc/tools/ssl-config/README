Configuration of lighttpd to support SSL.

To use lighttpd with SSL, a certificate and its private key must be available.
The following script generates a self-signed certificate that can
be used in lighttpd.
Before running it you should customize it with your specific
data. The main changes must be done in the lines between
"cat > "$CONF" << EOF" and "EOF"
If you customize settings outside of the previous lines you have to change
other scripts too.

gen_cert.sh


The file lighttpd-ssl.conf.sample is a template that must be customized
with the correct data.
The gen_light_conf.sh script can helpin generating a lighttpd configuration
file with data contained in the script itself and in _meta_dir.sh/_conf.sh files.


When the configuration files are correctly generated it is possible to
run start-server.sh and stop-server.sh to respectively start and stop
the servers (SOLR, Django and lighttpd).
 
The configuration file for lighttpd makes it possible to listen on two
separate ports: one for HTTP and one for HTTPS. All the requests for HTTP port
are redirected to HTTPS port.
