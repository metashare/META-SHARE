usage:
	./mserv.sh [start|stop|clean]
	
	start: starts all the configured nodes
	stop: stop all the configured nodes but leaves the node specific directories
			for inspection purposes
	clean: cleans the node specific directories
	
note: before running mserv.sh it is necessary to set the
environment variable METASHARE_SW_DIR. This must contain the directory
in which the Metashare software has been downloaded.

It is also necessary to set the environment variable TEST_DIR that
will contain all the data related to the servers. If this variable
is not set it will be used a 'test_dir' directory under the current
directory.


So, the typical use will be:
export METASHARE_SW_DIR=/path/to/dir
export TEST_DIR=/tmp  (or any other)
cd $METASHARE_SW_DIR/misc/multitest
./mserv.sh start
"run the tests"
./mserv.sh stop
./mserv.sh clean


The configuration of nodes is specified in the mconfig.py file.
This file contains a class that should hold information for
the nodes to be activated and the actual list of the nodes
that must be started. For each node it is possible to define
if it is an 'inner' or 'outer' node. If it is a 'outer' node
it is possible to specify the 'proxy' node to which
it will be connected.

It could be necessary to tune some parameter before running the mserv.sh.
The main problem could be to set the ports that will be used by the servers.
The default values are:
The port on which django servers listen for requests: 18001, 18002, 18003, etc
The port on which solr servers listen for requests: 4445, 4446, 4447, etc
The prot on which solr servers wait the stop command: 3334, 3335, 3336, etc
If the machine running the tests already uses some of these ports, the base value
of each of this set of ports must be changed:
django_port: after the end of the 'mconfig' class declaration, before
	the instantiation of nodes
solr_port_base, solr_stop_port_base: declared as class variables at the beginning of 'mconfig' class
Note: for each of this port the first actually used (for the first node) will be 'p + 1'.

The set of nodes is obtained by:
creating each node by 'cnf1 = mconfig()'
adding the node to the list by 'CONFIGS.append(cnf1)


Files in ./init_data
settings_test.py is the same as settings.py except that it 
imports dj_settings.local_settings instead of local_settings .

local_settings_test.py (not used anymore) uses the following environment variables:
DJANGO_PORT: the port number on which the python runserver is run.
DJANGO_CONF_NUM: is a progressive number used to name the database sqlite file.
      Es. metashare1.db, metshare2.db, etc.
SOLR_PORT: the port on which the related Solr server is running.

local_settings_test2.py contains some macros that will be
replaced with node specific data before starting each node.

metashare.db contains an empty database obtained by:
python manage.py syncdb
It has a superuser "admin" with password "secret", i.e., all started nodes will
have this superuser account.
