        Usage
        -----
        
        Define tasks
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Kronos collects tasks from ``cron`` modules in your project root and each of your applications::
        
            # app/cron.py
        
            import kronos
        
            @kronos.register('0 0 * * *')
            def complain():
                complaints = [
                    "I forgot to migrate our applications's cron jobs to our new server! Darn!",
                    "I'm out of complaints! Damnit!"
                ]
        
                print random.choice(complaints)
        
        Register tasks with cron
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        ::
        
            $ python manage.py installtasks

        * Fixed a bug that caused unclosed single quotes in the crontab to raise a ValueError
        
        0.2.1
        +++++
        
        * Fixed a bug that caused 'cron'-modules in the project root to be ignored.
